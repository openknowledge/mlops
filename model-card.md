### Model


| What  | Why  | Who |
|---|---|---|
| we used all 6 available features  |  saw a relevant linear correlation with risk and little correlation between the features | OZ  |
| we chose a 3 layer neural network with dropout, and batch normalization  | this is probably overkill for the problem, but this solution was just copy pasted from a previous project and did what it should  | OZ  |
