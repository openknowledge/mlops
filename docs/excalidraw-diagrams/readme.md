Excalidraw is a Paint Canvas inside your browser to enable you to create sketches.

## Working with Excalidraw

You can clear a canvas with the bin icon. Since a canvas will stay as long as your session is not cleared,
it could be that you see an old canvas. Also, if opening a canvas in a new tab, you will see the same
diagram. So you'll only be able to work in one tab, reimporting your diagrams.

Always be sure to export your diagram when closing the tab, just to be sure.

Importing and Exporting diagrams should be straight forward, you can also export the diagram directly
as an image file.
